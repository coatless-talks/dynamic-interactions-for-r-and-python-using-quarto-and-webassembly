## Overview

In this exercise, we'll turn our attention to crafting interactive slides. 

This exercise can be done using either `quarto-webr` or the `quarto-pyodide` extension. 

## Step-by-step

### Step into a Quarto Project

Before continuing, please make sure to be inside a Quarto Project within RStudio or VS Code. 

Refer back to our [first exercise](day02a-create-and-publish-rstudio.qmd) for help in creating a Quarto project or revisiting an existing Quarto project.

### Install the Quarto Extension

For new Quarto projects, please make sure to install the Quarto extension into the project by using:

::: {.panel-tabset group="quarto-extension"}
#### quarto-webr
```sh
quarto add coatless/quarto-webr
```
#### quarto-pyodide

```sh
quarto add coatless-quarto/pyodide
```
:::


If you wish to also use the [stanford RevealJS theme](https://quarto.thecoatlessprofessor.com/stanford/demos/template-revealjs.html#/title-slide), please also install the [quarto-stanford](https://github.com/coatless-quarto/stanford) theme extension:

```sh
quarto add coatless-quarto/stanford
```

### Create a new Quarto Document

Next, please create a new Quarto document.

### Modify the document YAML

For interactive slides, we must use the Quarto Revealjs format. Other formats for presentations will not work as they are not constructed with HTML.

We can create a default Revealjs slide deck can be obtained by using:

```yml
---
title: "Example RevealJS Slides"
subtitle: "Let's Rock and Roll!"
date: now
author:
  - name: FirstName LastName
    email: person@stanford.edu
format:
  revealjs: default
---
```

If you wish to use the stanford theme, please change the line under `format` to:

```yml
format:
  stanford-revealjs: default
```

### Modify the document header

Next, please modify the document header include the necessary filters

::: {.panel-tabset group="quarto-extension"}
#### quarto-webr

```yaml
---
engine: knitr
filters:
  - webr
---
```

#### quarto-pyodide

```yaml
---
filters:
  - pyodide
---
```
:::

### Removing the startup message

Sometimes it may not be ideal to display a message on the title slide covering the status of webR or Pyodide. This can be disabled with  `show-startup-message: false` under the relevant

::: {.panel-tabset group="quarto-extension"}
#### quarto-webr

```yaml
---
webr:
  show-startup-message: false
---
```

#### quarto-pyodide

```yaml
---
pyodide:
  show-startup-message: false
---
```
:::


### Create a new slide

By default, Revealjs uses header markdown syntax to denote sections of the slide deck and slides themselves.

A single `#` will create a new slide section while two `##` will generate a new slide. If you add three `###` or more, then the slide will start to have subheaders.

```md
# Section

## My Slide Title

Some slide contents
```

### Place an interactive code area

Next, create a slide that has an interactive code area present.

::: {.panel-tabset group="quarto-extension"}
#### quarto-webr

````md
## My slide 

Let's take a look at ... 

```{{webr-r}}
# R code here
```
````

#### quarto-pyodide

````md
## My slide 

Let's take a look at ... 

```{{pyodide-python}}
# Python code here
```
````
:::

### Render the document

Finally, please render the slide deck.
