# Dynamic Interactions

A series of guest lectures in STATS 352 at Stanford University during Spring 2024.

## Abstract

These lectures delve into the world of dynamic interactions available through interactive documents by exploring the integration of web-based versions of R and Python within the Quarto framework. The dynamic capabilities of the Quarto publishing framework, coupled with in-browser versions of leading data science language distributions based on WebAssembly, offer a unique platform for real-time code execution, fostering interactive experiences in data analysis and scientific computing. Weâ€™ll discuss how this approach not only fosters interactive experiences in data analysis and scientific computing but also provides a powerful and versatile toolset for researchers, educators, and practitioners.
