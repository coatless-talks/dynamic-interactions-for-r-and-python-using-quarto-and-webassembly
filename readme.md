# Dynamic Interactions for R and Python using Quarto and WebAssembly


## Abstract

These lectures delve into the world of dynamic interactions available
through interactive documents by exploring the integration of web-based
versions of R and Python within the Quarto framework. The dynamic
capabilities of the Quarto publishing framework, coupled with in-browser
versions of leading data science language distributions based on
WebAssembly, offer a unique platform for real-time code execution,
fostering interactive experiences in data analysis and scientific
computing. Weâ€™ll discuss how this approach not only fosters interactive
experiences in data analysis and scientific computing but also provides
a powerful and versatile toolset for researchers, educators, and
practitioners.
