## Dynamic Interactions for R and Python using Quarto and WebAssembly

### Abstract

These lectures delve into the world of dynamic interactions available through interactive documents by exploring the integration of web-based versions of R and Python within the Quarto framework. The dynamic capabilities of the Quarto publishing framework, coupled with in-browser versions of leading data science language distributions based on WebAssembly, offer a unique platform for real-time code execution, fostering interactive experiences in data analysis and scientific computing. We’ll discuss how this approach not only fosters interactive experiences in data analysis and scientific computing but also provides a powerful and versatile toolset for researchers, educators, and practitioners.
